Simple-Secured-PHP-Contact-Form-
================================

This contact form uses 3 seperate scripts: 
<ul>
  <li><b>index.html </b> - Display the form</li>
  <li><b>formprocess.php</b> - Receive and process the form's data with security in mind</li>
  <li><b>mystyle.css</b> - Style the contact form and error messages</li>
</ul>
  
  All the input form fields are properly validated and sanitized in order to protect form data from hackers and spammers.
  
  You can edit the HTML and CSS script according to the need of your website design.
  
  Do not forget to replace with your email address you wish to receive contact messages to. 
  To replace open formprocess.php file and insert you email address instead of "youemailaddress@gmail.com"
  
  <b>Note:</b> Just to remind php deosn't actuall mail anything. Mail is handled by your server's send mail command.
